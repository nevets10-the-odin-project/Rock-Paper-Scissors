## Introduction - Part 1

For this project, you will create the game Rock Paper Scissors. This game will be played entirely in the console.

## Introduction - Part 2

Now that we can manipulate the DOM, it’s time to revisit Rock Paper Scissors and add a UI to it.

Before you start making changes to your Rock Paper Scissors project, you need to learn about a concept in Git called branching so that you can make your changes without having to worry about breaking what you have now.

Branches in Git allow your repository to hold multiple alternate reality versions of your files at the same time. You’ve actually (sort of) been using branches since you made your first commit, you just might not have known it! Back in the setting up Git lesson when you ran git config --global init.defaultBranch main you were setting the name of what’s called the default branch for your repos. The default branch is just what we call the branch that is created when you make your first commit on a project, and in that command we set the name to be main as is the current standard.

Like the branches in a tree (hence the name), all of the branches for a project stem off of a “trunk” (the main branch) or off of other branches.

When you make commits on a specific branch, those changes only exist on that branch, leaving all of your other branches exactly as they were when you branched off of them.

This means that you can keep your main branch as a place for only finished features that you know are working properly, and add each feature to your project using dedicated branches which we call feature branches.

## Post project reflection 1:
This took a little longer than expected since I went back and forth on a few choices and I added a few things that weren't explicitly mentioned in the prompt. However, I think it turned out pretty good.

## Post project reflection 2 - Post UI branch:
This was probably way too overkill for the actual assignment, but I wanted to make something that I would actually enjoy looking at.

I also wanted to have the computer cycling through their choices as it waits for the player, but I ditched that idea to get this done in a timely manner. Maybe I'll add it later...
